## Activity File: Digital Signatures

In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a security analyst working for the Hill Valley Police Department.

- Captain Strickland has sent you several more urgent messages about the Alphabet Bandit case.

- It's quite likely that one of the messages was sent by the Alphabet Bandit pretending to be Captain Strickland to throw off the investigation.

- Your task is to use GPG to determine which of the messages is not authentic.

### Instructions

2. Import Captain Strickland's [public key](../../../resources/strickland_publickey.gpg).

3. Use GPG to determine which of the messages are not authentic and thus not from Captain Strickland.
