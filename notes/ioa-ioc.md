## There are two primary types of indicators:





- **Indicators of attack (IOA)** indicate attacks happening in real time.
  - Proactive approach to intrusion attempts.
  - Indicate that an attack is currently in progress but a full breach has not been determined or has not occurred yet. 
  - Focus on revealing the intent and end goal of the attacker regardless of the exploit or malware used in the attack.

- **Indicators of compromise** (**IOC**) indicate previous malicious activity. 

  - Reactive approach to successful intrusions.
  - Indicate that an attack occurred, resulting in a breach.
  - Used to establish an adversary's techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs).
  - Expose all of the vulnerabilities used in an attack, giving network defenders the opportunity to revamp their defense as part of their mitigation strategy, and learn from an attack so it won't happen again.
