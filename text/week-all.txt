.. Encoding
... Encoding is for
Encoding is for maintaining data usability and can be reversed by employing the same algorithm that encoded the content, i.e. no key is used.

.... common use of encoding
common use of encoding is to transform digital text to binary data

.... what online tools are available for encoding/decoding
[Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/tools/binary-to-text)

[Rapid Tables](https://www.rapidtables.com/)

.... Binary Encoding
..... how many bits in a byte
a byte is equal to 8 bits
each byte can represent a decimal (0-255 for a count of 256)
binary to decimal encoding translates bytes to decimals

.... ASCII Encoding
ASCII represents every upper and lowercase letter of the english alphabet
as well as common punctuation marks and graphic and mathematical symbols

... Hex and Octal Encoding
Hexidecimal composed of 0-9 + A-F


.. Encryption
... encryption is the process of using a cypher
... cipher is encryption algorithm
... cipher Types

.... Stream Cipher
apply algorithm on bit or character at a time
eg Ceasar Cipher

.... Substitution Cipher
eg Caesar and Enigma

.... Block Cipher
apply algorithm to chuncks of characters
eg Transposition Cipher

.... Transposition Cipher
breaks message into blocks and rearranges the letters of each block


... Symmetric encryption ~ uses the same key to encrypt/decrypt
symmetric encryption relies on a shared (private) key and
uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information

.... DES (1977)
uses a 56-bit key
many flaws
.... 3DES
.... AES (1997)
Advanced Encryption Standard (1997)
the Rijndael cipher
offers multiple strengths 128, 192 and 256-bits

.... Using OpenSSL SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION
openSSL can encrypt and decrypt messages

..... create the key and initialization vector
openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -k mypassword >key_and_iv

...... read that
encryption, key-type, salting, cipher-name

...... what is the key
it is a private key

...... what is the iv
initialization vector

..... send key, iv and message to recipiant

..... openssl asymmetric encryption 
echo $msg | openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -base64 -K <kkk> -iv <iviviv> >$enc-file

..... openssl asymmetric decryption command
echo $msg | openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -base64 -d -K $key -iv $iv >$enc-file


... Asymmetric encryption ~ uses public-private keypair
asymmetric encryption relies on a public-private keypair 
where one is used to enrypt, the other to decrypt
also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption, 
uses mathematically linked public- and private-key pairs 
.... RSA, Diffe-Hellman, ECC, El Gamal, and DSA.


.... Using GPG, ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION and decryption
..... create the key pair
gpg --gen-key < real-name email-addy pass-phrase
..... list keys in ring
gpg --list-keys
l /home/robforee/.gnupg/
..... export julie@email.com public key and share
gpg --armor --output julie.gpg --export julie@email.com
--- begin pgp --- end pgp 
..... import julie public key
gpg --import julie.gpg
..... encrypt message to send to julie
gpg --armor --output Tims_encryptedmessage.txt --encrypt --recipient julie@email.com Tims_plainmessage.txt
..... encrypt message message from Tim
gpg --output Tims_decrypted_message --decrypt Tims_encryptedmessage.txt



... key space
a range of number that hand be used for a specific algorithm
eg key of 1 digit has a keyspace of 10
defined by bit size

.... how much more secure is X more bits of encryption
for each bit added, the key space doubles
calculate space as 2^[bit-size]


... Secure Key Exchange
disadvantage of symmetric key cryptography is insecure methods of distributing the keys.

.... Offline exchange
.... Diffie-Hellman key exchange

... Key management
Another disadvantage of symmetric key cryptography is key management.
If you have a key for everyone you are sending to (in an organization!)

.... calculate symmetric keys for 12 people
(12 * 11) / 2 = 66
num-keys = ( N * (N-1) ) / 2  ~ num-kes( 6 ) = 15

.... calculate asymmetric keys for 12 people
num-keys = ( N * 2 )          ~ num-keys( 6 ) = 12





.. -------
.. Hashing
... Hashing creates a message digest
message digest, fingerprint, hash, checksum 
unique identifier of plaintext 
cannot be converted back to plaintext
a one way function

... SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms) SHA1 SHA2
... MD (Message Digest) MD2 MD4 MD5
... LM NTLM Microsoft algos

... Using md5sum
.... md5sum secretmessage.txt > hashes.txt {hash+filename}
.... md5sum -c hashes.txt > md5check.txt
... Using sha256sum
.... sha256sum secretmessage.txt > hashes.txt {hash+filename}
.... sha256sum -c hashes.txt > md5check.txt

... Using Hashcat
.... hashcat cracks (unsalted) hashed password hashes
..... hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o solved.txt hash.txt rockyou.txt --force
..... cat ~/.hashcat/hashcat.potfile

.. -------
.. Digital Signatures
... Signature types
.... detached signature
....  all-at-once
....  clearsigned
....  signed hash
... Signing with gpg
.... Tim creats a key
gpg --gen-key < name, email, passphrase
.... Tim exports his public key
gpg --armor --output tim.gpg --export tim@email.com
.... Tim signs the message < passphrase
..... using recipient public key for encryption
..... using sender private key to sign
gpg --output Tims_signature --armor --detach-sig Tims_message.txt
.... Send the message and signature  
.... recipient validate the signature 
..... using recipient private for decryption
..... using sender public key to verify signature
gpg --import tim.gpg
gpg --verify Tims_signature Tims_message.txt

.. Obfuscation is for
Obfuscation is used to prevent people from understanding the meaning of something, and is often used with computer code to help prevent successful reverse engineering and/or theft of a productâ€™s functionality.

.... steganography to find messages in images

... SSL Certificates
.... X.509 certificate
..... company documents
..... unique IP address
..... CSR ~ Certificate Signing Request ~ which contains public key
.... chain of trust ~ root ships with OS
..... root certificate authority > intermediate certificate authority
.... 6 Step certificate usage
..... 1 client request cert, 2 server send cert+key, 3 client verify date+root
..... 4 client create and send session key
..... 5 server decrypts session key with own private key
..... 6 two way encrypted communication for this session
.... using both asymmetric and symmetric keys (step 6)
.... SSL vs TLS protocols
