. Firewalls
.. 2 Firewall Architectures
... using UFW
... using firewalld Usage
... using nmap usage for testing firewall rules
.. 2 Intrusion Detection (IDS)
... IDS Architecture
... IDS Types
... using snort for intrusion detection

. Network Security
.. NSM ~ network security monitoring
... NSM Focus 
threat-centric, visibility of attack, statistics generator (IOA and IOCs)
... NSM Pros / Cons
.... activity tracnking, situational awareness, incident response, forensics
.... unable to deencrypt, needs better hardware, stores PII, needs a tap
... NSM Stages
.... Detection
.... Response
... NSM Sensor connectivity
.... SPAN ~ Mirrored port
.... TAP ~ Network Test Access Point

.. using Security Onion for forensic investigation
... contains many NSM tools to add layers of defense and help enforce the kill chain
... Security Onion tools   ~ network forensic investigation tools
.... using Snort to collect data
.... using Sguil to display filtered data from snort IDS engine
.....     ~ Alert Panel, Snort Rule, Packet Data, IP Resolution
.... using Transcript to render tcpflow
.... using NetworkMinder for advanced analysis and extraction
....     ~ advanced NTA (network traffic analysis)
....     ~ open from Sguil interface > select alert-id > right-click
....     ~ tabs [files,..]
.... using virustotal.com to check a file for known malware signatures


.. ESM ~ Enterprise security monitoring
... using Security Onion as alert aggrigator
...       ~ using ossec server for alert storage
... using OSSEC agent to detect and alert host intrusion (HIDS)
....      ~ monitors all syslog data
..... using Elastic Stack to analyze packet captures
.....     ~ elasticscarch, logstash, kabana
..... using logstash to store alerts
..... using squert as web ui to sguil databse
..... using sguil as database interface
..... using kibana to access elastic data analytics engine

.. Threat Hunting
... Threat Intelligence Cards
.... TPP
..... Reconnaissance 
The threat actor utilized online resources such as Facebook, DNS registration websites, and the "About" page of the company website. 
..... Weaponization 
The creation of a Remote Access Trojan or RAT Downloader.    
..... Delivery 
A breached corporate email account.                          
..... Exploitation 
Crusher.exe is an executable hidden inside of a .pdf document that establishes persistence by modifying Windows registry key C:\ Windows\System32\config under the names SAM, SECURITY, SOFTWARE and SYSTEM. 
..... Installation 
A user who clicks on the email attachment.                   
..... Command & Control (C2)
A command channel tunnels through Internet Relay Chat (IRC) establishing a connection to the attacker's server. 
..... Actions on Objectives
Attacker exfiltrates private user account information.
