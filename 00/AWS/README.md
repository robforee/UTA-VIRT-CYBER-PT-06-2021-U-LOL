#### AWS Pricing Model
	- AWS Pricing Whitepaper: 
		- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/how-aws-pricing-works/how-aws-pricing-works.pdf
	- Capex vs Opex
		- Capital Expenditure - Pay up front, fixed sunk cost
		- Operational Expenditure - Pay as you go, and pay for what you use
	- AWS pricing philosophy
		- Pay as you go
		- Pay for what you use
		- Pay less as you use more
		- Pay even less when you reserve capacity
	- Key principles and best practices
		- Understand the fundamentals of pricing
		- Start early with cost optimization
		- Maximize the power of flexibility
		- Use the right pricing model for the job
	- Understand the fundamentals of pricing
		- Compute
		- Storage
		- Data out bound
	- Start early with cost optimization
		- Put cost controls in place before your environment grows out of control
	- Maximize the power of flexibility
		- Pay for what your need when you need
		- Turn off things you are not using
	- Use the right pricing model for the job

#### IAM Best Practice
	- Do not use your root account to login
	- Always enable MFA when possible
	- One user should use one real human - do not have phantom users
	- Use roles to access different AWS services
	- Always place users to groups and assign the required roles to groups
	- Have strong password policy
	- Use IAM credential report to audit user permissions

#### S3 - Simple Storage Service
	- S3 is object based, key/value pair storage solution
	- File stored are in different locations (physical servers)
	- File size can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB, unlimited storage
	- Bucket names are globally unique
	- When file upload to a bucket is successful, HTTP 200 will be received
	- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
	- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELTES
	- AWS guarantees for S3
		- S3 platform is built 99.99% availability
		- but AWS gurantees 99.9% availability
		- 99.999999999% durability for S3 data (11 9s)
	- Features
		- Tiered storage
		- Lifecycle management
		- Versioning
		- Encryption
		- Secure data using Access Control Lists (ACL) and Bucket Polices
	- Storage classes - https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/
		- S3 Standard - 99.99% availability, 11 9 durability, can sustain 2 facility failure
		- S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed) - lower fees than standard, but charged when accessing data
		- S3 one zone IA - IA with lower cost but no data replication across different AZs
		- S3 Intellegent Tiering - moves your data based on your usage pattern
		- S3 Glacier - for data archiving, takes minutes or hours to access (configurable), lower cost
		- S3 Glacier Deep Archive - lowest cost, but data retrieval time takes 12 hours or more
	- Charges
		- Storage
		- Requests
		- Storage management pricing
		- Data transfer pricing
		- Transfer acceleration
		- Cross region replication

### EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute - Virtual Machine
	- Pricing model
		- On Demand - pay a fixed rate by the second with no commitment
		- Reserved - contract terms of 1 or 3 years, discount from on demand
			- Standard Reserved Instances - Up to 75% off on demand instances, instance type specific
			- Convertable Reserved Instances - Up to 54% off on demand instances, can convert between different instance types
			- Scheduled Reserved Instances - Reserve instances based on time windows to match capacity requirements
		- Spot - bid on a price, you will get the server when the price drops below your bid
			- If a spot instance is terminated by AWS, you don't have to pay for full hour. If you terminate a spot instance, you pay for the full hour
		- Dedicated hosts - physical EC2 server dedicated for your use only
	- Usange
		- On Demand
			- For users that want flexiablity without up front payment
			- Good for applications that have unpredicatble usage
			- Useful for testing instances
		- Reserved
			- Good for applications that are in steady state or predicatble usage
			- The longer the reserved period, the better the pricing
		- Spot
			- Useful for application that have flexible start and end times
			- Good for application that are only feasible at very low compute prices (ex. DNA sequencing applications)
		- Dedicated hosts
			- Needed for regulatory requirements that disallow the use of multi-tenant virtualization (ex. government applications)
			- Good for software that have licensing requirments that do not support multi-tenancy
			- Can be purchased on demand as well as reserved
	- Instance types
		- F1, I3, G4, H1, T4g, D2, R6g, M6g, C6g, P3, X1e, Z1D, A1, U-12TB1
		- T4g - T class - lowest cost general purpose - web server/small DBs
		- M6g - M class - general purpose, higher specs than T class - application servers
		- C6g - C class - compute optimized, better CPU for CPU intensive apps
		- R6g - R class - memory optimized, better RAM for memory intensive apps

### EBS - Elastic Block Storage
	- SSD
		- General Purpose SSD (GP2) - blanaces prices and perforamce for wide variety of workloads
		- Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) - highest performance SSD for low-latency and high-throughput
	- Magnetic
		- Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) - low cost HDD designed for frequencly accessed workloads
		- Cold HDD (SC1) - lowest cost HDD volume for less frequently accessed data

### Database
	- RDS - Relational Database Service
		- Database types
			- MS SQL Server
			- Oracle
			- MySQL Server
			- PostgreSQL
			- Aurora - created by AWS
			- MariaDB
	- Key features
		- Multi-AZ - for disaster recover
		- Read replicas - for performance, up to 5 copies
	- DynamoDB - Non-relational Database created by AWS
	- OLTP vs OLAP
		- OnLine Trasactions Processing - used for basic database queries
			- Example: give me user with id 22312
		- OnLine Analitics Processing - more complex queries, used for Business Intellengenc (BI) 
			- Example: give me earning of product xyz in the Europe market for Q2 and compare with Q1
			- Data warehousing used to run OLAP queries outside of production database
			- Redshift - AWS's data warehouse solution
	- ElastiCache - used to cache common queries from database for better performance 
		- Example: Amazon's home page can be visited by thousands of users any given moment, it would be better to cache that result instead of querying the database
		- Memcached and Redis are the two different solutions for ElastiCache
